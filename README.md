Find the Largest Number using Quantum Algorithm
I wrote this code as solution to a screening task for 7th Cohort of the QOSF Mentorship Program
Original task read: You have two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which is the larger number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers in case
